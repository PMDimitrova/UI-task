//TODO: this will be component which can add and remove items from itself

// TODO: Duplicates choices are not allowed.
// TODO: There cannot be more than 50 choices total.
// TODO: the dropdown in OrderDropdown should trigger another order of the items here

// BONUS: The database that stores this does not allow individual choices in the list of choices to be longer than 40 characters. Add client-side validation such that excess characters are visually distinct if the choice is longer than 40 characters. I.e., if a user enters the word that is longer than 40 characters, the characters above 40 would be highlighted in red.

const ChoicesArea = () => <div>choices</div>;

export default ChoicesArea;
